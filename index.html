        <p>
            SO I decided to dive into Tech after years of experience as a field personel, <br>
            managing people and resources, in my inquisitiveness, I decideed to try a differnt thing. <br>
            I decided to dive into Tech and choose software development as a new career path. So far so good, <br>
            It have been interesting at some point and stressing as well. My experince so far is that physical <br>
            classes are more interesting than virtual learnig because it encourages better collaborations and team <br>
            learning. Many thanks to all my teachers. <br>
